# card-game-template

While I was building a Blackjack game, I noticed I built a template for drawing cards from decks of various sizes and displaying a custom style of playing cards.

So I saved this template as a base for myself or anyone who wants to use it for building any card games in the future.

Library/framework used:
- boostrap 5.13
- Axios (for API resquests)

API used: 
- Deck of Cards API: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
